# Installation

First thing we need to do is setup the folder structure and install some files that need to be in place for everything to work correctly.  

Run the following script
```
wget -qO- https://git.io/JPXF5 | bash
```

Your output should look something like this

```
# wget -qO- https://git.io/JPXF5 | bash
```
