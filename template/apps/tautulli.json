Most importantly, these statistics include what has been watched, who watched it, when and where they watched it, and how it was watched. All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your server to everyone else.[br][br]\r\n  [b][u][span style='color: #E80000;']Configuration[/span][/u][/b][br]\r\n  [b]8181[/b] The webui for Tautulli's webui [br]\r\n  [b]/config[/b] Storing Configuration and the Tautulli database[br]\r\n[b]/logs[/b] Map to you plex logs (required for IP logging)[br]\r\n\r\n",
